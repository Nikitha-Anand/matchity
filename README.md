# Matchity

Matchity is a platform that connects companies with local charities based on shared values, interests, and community needs.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration came from observing the friction between corporate resources and community needs.  
While many companies and their employees are eager to engage with their local communities, the *distance* between a corporate office and a charity can make starting a partnership feel overwhelming.

We wanted to close this gap by building a system that replaces manual searching with automated, value-based matching, making it easier for neighbours to become partners.

## What It Does

**Matchity** connects companies with charities that align with their interests and values.  
Instead of searching through endless lists, organizations can discover relevant community partners through intelligent matching.

## How We Built It

Matchity was built using a full-stack approach with multiple technologies:

- **Java** & **Spring Boot** for backend web development  
- **MongoDB Atlas** for data storage  
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** for the frontend  
- **Gemini AI API** to assist with intelligent matching and insights

## Challenges We Ran Into

- Tight time constraints  
- A steep learning curve across multiple tools and frameworks  

Despite this, we pushed through by learning quickly, collaborating closely, and supporting each other.

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of

- Building a **working product** — seeing our code come to life was incredibly rewarding  
- Successfully learning and using **GitHub** to collaborate and manage our repository  
- Strong team synergy and communication throughout the project  
- Experiencing the excitement of debugging and finally seeing features work

---

## What We Learned

- Applying **Big-O notation** concepts from class to real-world logic  
- Refreshing and strengthening our knowledge of:
  - CSS & HTML  
  - Databases  
  - Front-end development  
- How to work effectively as a team under time pressure

##  What’s Next for Matchity

Our next goal is to make Matchity more **proactive**:

- Integrate **local news feeds** so the app can flag urgent charity needs (e.g., storms or local crises)
- Allow employees to **sign up for volunteer days directly** through a match
- Enable charities to send back **photo updates**, so companies can see the real-world impact of their support  

We want Matchity to turn donations into lasting, visible community relationships.
